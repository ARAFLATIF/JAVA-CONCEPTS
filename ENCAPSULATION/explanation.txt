Explanation
Encapsulation:
The BankAccount class encapsulates the data members accountNumber, accountHolderName, and balance by declaring them as private.
Public getter and setter methods are provided to access and modify these private fields in a controlled manner.
Getter and Setter Methods:
The getter methods (getAccountNumber, getAccountHolderName, getBalance) allow you to retrieve the values of the private fields.
The setter methods (setAccountNumber, setAccountHolderName, setBalance) allow you to modify the values of the private fields, with additional validation in the case of setBalance.
Deposit and Withdraw Methods:
These methods demonstrate how you can perform operations on the encapsulated data while maintaining data integrity. 
For example, you cannot deposit or withdraw a negative amount, and you cannot withdraw more than the available balance.
Display Details Method:
This method is used to display the current state of the account, showcasing how encapsulated data can be accessed through public methods.
This example illustrates how encapsulation helps in hiding the internal implementation details of an object and 
exposing only necessary information through public methods, ensuring data integrity and security.
