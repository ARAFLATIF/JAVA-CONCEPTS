Explanation
Inheritance:
The AudioBook and Ebook classes extend the abstract Book class, inheriting its properties and methods.
Each concrete class overrides the displayDetails method to provide specific details about the book type.
Abstraction:
The Book class is an abstract class that provides a common interface for all types of books.
The displayDetails method is declared abstract, forcing concrete subclasses to implement it.
Polymorphism:
The User class uses a list and map of Book objects, allowing it to store and retrieve different types of books polymorphically.
HashMap and ArrayList:
The User class uses a HashMap to store books by title for efficient retrieval and an ArrayList to maintain a list of all books.
This program demonstrates OOP principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism while utilizing collections like ArrayList and HashMap.
